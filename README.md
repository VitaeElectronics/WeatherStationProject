# Weather Station Project
This project follows the development of an Arduino and Raspberry Pi based weather monitoring system that will support remote access capabilities.

Key Components
- Arduino system(s) for weather data sampling and system power assessment
- Raspberry Pi system manages overall system power and IoT processes
- Cloud system will manage the following
  1. Website for weather data analysis
  2. User authentication protocols for weather application
  3. (Potentially) Weather report tooling and forecasting
